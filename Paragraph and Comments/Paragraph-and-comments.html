	Quality of software vs quality in manufacturing
	It is difficult to write complete and unambiguous software requirements. Software developers and customers may have a different perception of the requirements and they may not agree to a single solution(reach agreement) on whether the specifications are met.
•	</p>
	<p>
	Specifications are collected from different stakeholders. Some of the requirements can be excluded. The stakeholders whose specifications were not included may perceive the system as not a quality software even though the software implements the agreed requirements.
	•
	It is impossible to measure certain quality characteristics such as maintainability directly.
