	<h2>Paragraph Text</h2>
	
	<p>
	<strong><u>Quality of software vs quality in manufacturing</u></strong>
	It is difficult to write complete and unambiguous software requirements.<br> Software developers and customers may have a different perception of the requirements and they may not agree to a single solution(reach agreement) on whether the specifications are met.
•	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>New paragraph</h2>
	<p>
	<i>Specifications</i> are collected from <em>different stakeholders</em>.<br/> Some of the requirements can be excluded. The stakeholders whose specifications were not included may perceive the system as not a quality software even though the software implements the agreed requirements.
	•<br/>
	It is impossible to measure certain quality characteristics such as maintainability directly.
